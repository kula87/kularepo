## 1. Introduction

Logging is crucial for troubleshooting, debugging, and monitoring in software development. Log patterns or formats provide a structured approach to logging, simplifying analysis and interpretation of log files. This guide will discuss log patterns, their importance, best practices, and integration with existing tools, ultimately improving system monitoring, security, and decision-making.

## 2. What is a Log Pattern?

A log pattern is a standardized format for log messages, helps easier parsing and analysis. It contains key information like timestamp, log level, source, message, and additional context, aiding in troubleshooting and decision-making processes.


## 3. Importance of Log Pattern
Log patterns are essential for efficient debugging, ensuring regulatory compliance, enhancing system security, effective monitoring, and guiding data-driven decision-making.

| Aspect       | Description                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Debugging    | Aids in identifying and fixing issues in the code.          |
| Compliance   | Ensures accountability and transparency as per regulations. |
| Security     | Alerts about suspicious activities within a system.         |
| Monitoring   | Provides insights about the system's state and behavior.    |
| Decision-making | Guides business and operational decisions with data-driven insights. |


## 4. Types of Logs
- **Application Logs**: These logs contain information about the behavior of an application, such as user behavior, application process state, and more.

- **Access Logs**: These logs record who accessed what resources and when, which is important for audits and security reviews.

- **Error Logs**: These logs contain information about programmatic and run-time errors, which is crucial for debugging and issue resolution.

- **Security Logs**: These logs track security-related events like login attempts, authorization checks, etc.

- **Audit Logs**: These logs record chronological documentation of any activities that could affect a particular operation or procedure.

- **Metric Logs**: These logs keep track of the quantitative data about a system, like system performance or resource usage.

## 5. Best Practices
"Best Practices" in the logging strategy guidelines outlines the recommended logging structure, illustrates logging pattern examples, and explains essential aspects such as retention period, rotation strategy, and backup/archiving policies.

## 5.1. Logging Pattern and Structure
   Standardize the log message format, which should include, but not be limited to:
   - Timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
   - Log level
   - Application or module name
   - IP address (if applicable)
   - Transaction ID
   - Message (with clear and concise descriptions)
   - Any relevant contextual data (e.g., user ID, request parameters)

   Logging Output:
- JSON format

Naming Convension (Casing standard):
- In logging, no strict casing standard exists. However, common conventions and best practices help maintain consistency and readability. 
Table summarizing the lowercase/uppercase conventions for various aspects of logging:

| Aspect           | Convention       | Example                                   |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Log Levels       | Uppercase        | "INFO", "DEBUG", "WARN", "ERROR", "FATAL" |
| JSON Keys        | camelCase/snake_case | "responseTimeMs", "response_time_ms"     |
| Component Names  | PascalCase/camelCase/snake_case | "DatabaseManager", "apiRequest", "user_service"    |
| Log Messages     | Sentence case    | "User successfully logged in"             |

In this case, "DatabaseManager" is a class or component name in PascalCase, "apiRequest" is a function or method name in camelCase, and "user_service" is a component name in snake_case. Note that different languages and codebases might have different conventions. 

### 5.1.1 Timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
The timestamp format in the provided examples is in ISO 8601 format, which is a widely used international standard for date and time representations. The format is as follows:

YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ

Example format:

| Format                  | Description                                                     | Example                  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ`  | ISO 8601 format with a time zone offset expressed in hours      | `2023-05-08T14:30:15+09:00` |
| `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ` | ISO 8601 format with milliseconds and a time zone offset in hours | `2023-05-08T14:30:15.223+09:00` |


Including local time in logs isn't advised, as it may cause confusion when correlating events. However, if needed, add a field like "jp_time" to log entries.

{
  "timestamp": "2023-05-08T14:35:10.123Z",
  "jp_time": "2023-05-08T23:35:10.123+09:00",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "User login successful",
  "userId": "12345",
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1"
}

### 5.1.2 Log levels
Two tables clarify logging levels and environments. Table A details levels, logged info, and actions; Table B shows common levels for development, testing, staging, and production.

**Table A**

| Level | Information to be logged                                         | Action to be taken            |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| DEBUG | Variable values, internal states, execution flow                | Diagnose and debug issues     |
| INFO  | Application start-up/shutdown, significant events/ops, No sensitive information | Monitor app state and behavior |
| WARN  | Configuration issues, deprecated API usage, Performance-related concerns | Investigate potential problems |
| ERROR | Exception details, stack traces, relevant context data         | Resolve errors and exceptions |
| FATAL | Critical issues that require immediate attention                | Address critical failures     |

**Table B**

| Environment | Level                                                                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DEV         | Free to use any level. DEBUG or INFO level is commonly set up.                                 |
| TEST        | Free to use any level. DEBUG or INFO level is commonly set up.                                 |
| STG         | Free to use any level. INFO level is appropriate, DEBUG is optional.                           |
| PROD        | INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL levels. DEBUG level is generally disabled in production.          |


### 5.1.3 Application or module name
The application or module name in logs helps identify the source of log messages, improving traceability and facilitating troubleshooting.

### 5.1.4 IP address (if applicable)
The IP address in logs, when applicable, provides information about the client or server involved in an event, aiding in the identification of potential security issues or debugging network-related problems.

### 5.1.5 Transaction ID
Using a standard transaction ID for log entries related to one request or operation aids tracing, debugging, and monitoring. Here's more on transaction IDs' importance and implementation.

Table summarizing the key aspects of using a standard transaction ID across all log entries related to a single request or operation.

Aspect | Description | Why/What/How to do | Example | Sample Patterns | Summary Description
-------|-------------|--------------------|---------|----------------|-------------------
Transaction ID | A unique identifier assigned to each request or operation | Allows for correlation and tracing of logs related to a single transaction | UUID, GUID, or a custom format | `c1a89a5b-2075-4e72-a9a1-0e6cddbf0a21` | UUID as a transaction ID
Propagate ID | Ensure the transaction ID is passed between internal and external API calls, services, and components | Helps maintain the traceability of logs across distributed systems | Pass the transaction ID in HTTP headers, message queues, or other communication methods | `X-Request-ID: c1a89a5b-2075-4e72-a9a1-0e6cddbf0a21` | Transaction ID passed via HTTP header
Include ID in logs | Include the transaction ID in each log entry related to the request or operation | Allows logs to be filtered and aggregated based on the transaction ID | Add the transaction ID to the log entry structure | `"transactionId": "c1a89a5b-2075-4e72-a9a1-0e6cddbf0a21"` | Transaction ID in log entry
Use standard format | Use a consistent format for transaction IDs across all applications and systems | Facilitates log correlation and analysis, regardless of the application or system generating the logs | Stick to a standardized format like UUID or GUID | - | Consistent ID format
Log analysis | Use log analysis tools that support transaction ID-based filtering and correlation | Simplifies the process of tracing logs related to a single request or operation | Configure Splunk or Kibana to recognize and filter logs based on the transaction ID | - | Log filtering by transaction ID

UUID: Universally Unique Identifier (Globally unique identifier (GUID). It is a 128-bit number. Ex: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000.
### 5.1.6 Message
Message: The main content of a log entry that describes the event or action, usually in a clear and concise manner. For example, "User logged in" or "File upload failed."

### 5.1.7 Contextual data
Contextual Data: Additional information that accompanies the message to provide context and help in understanding the event. It includes details like user ID, request parameters, file name, or transaction amount. For example, for a "User logged in with ID" message, the contextual data could be the user's ID and login timestamp. Such as,  "User logged in with ID 123", "File 'report.pdf' not found", or "Payment of $50 processed successfully for user 456".

### 5.2.3 Logging pattern for API calls
Logging standards for API calls can vary depending on the organization and the project. However, the general guidelines to follow when logging request and response data for GET and POST API calls.

Request Type | Description | Sample Pattern | About Sample Pattern
-------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------
GET Request | Log request parameters and metadata | `{"timestamp": "2023-05-08T15:30:00.000Z", "level": "INFO", "message": "GET request", "url": "/api/v1/resource", "queryParams": {"id": "1234"}, "headers": {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"}}` | Example of a log entry for a GET request, including request metadata, URL, query parameters, and headers

## 5.3. Retention Period
Retention period refers to the length of time that log data is stored and maintained before it is either deleted or archived.

Table summarizing the aspects to consider when determining a retention period for your logs:

Aspect | Description | Example | About Example
-------|-------------|---------|--------------
Regulatory Compliance | Legal requirements and industry regulations may dictate the retention period | GDPR requires log data containing personal data to be retained for no longer than necessary | In the EU, organizations must comply with GDPR's data retention requirements
Operational Needs | Retention period should align with the operational needs and use cases for log data | Retaining logs for 30 days to support troubleshooting, root cause analysis, and trend analysis | A company may decide 30 days is sufficient for their operational needs
Performance & Storage | Balancing the need for longer retention periods with the cost and performance implications of storing large volumes of log data | Storing logs for 6 months on a dedicated storage server, then archiving them offsite | A compromise between retaining logs and managing storage costs and performance
Security & Incident Response | Longer retention periods may be necessary for detecting and responding to security incidents | Retaining logs for 90 days to support the detection of slow, low-volume attacks | This allows security teams to identify patterns and trends over an extended period
Business Requirements | Retention period should meet any specific business requirements or policies | An organization may require logs to be retained for 1 year for auditing and compliance purposes | The organization's policy dictates a specific retention period based on their unique needs


### 5.4. Rotation Strategy
Log rotation or log rolling, is a technique used to manage log files by periodically renaming, compressing, or deleting them as they grow in size or age.

Table summarizing the common log rotation techniques and considerations:

Here's the revised table summarizing the common log rotation techniques with their descriptions, pros, and cons:

| Technique          | Description                                                                                              | Pros                                           | Cons                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Time-based Rotation| Rotate log files based on time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)                                  | Predictable rotation schedule, easy to manage | May result in large log files if log generation rate is high         |
| Size-based Rotation| Rotate log files when they reach a specific size limit                                                    | Prevents excessive disk space usage           | Frequent rotations if log generation rate is high or size limit is low|
| Log File Count     | Maintain a specified number of log files, deleting or archiving the oldest when the limit is reached     | Controls disk space usage, recent log data readily available | May lose older log data if file count is low or log generation rate is high|
| Compression        | Compress older log files to save disk space while retaining data for future reference                    | Saves disk space while retaining log data     | Increases time required to access and analyze compressed log data    |
| Deletion or Archiving | Delete or archive log files that exceed a specific age or size limit to enforce retention policies | Enforces retention policies, controls disk space usage | May lose historical log data if not properly managed               |
| Manual Intervention| Administrators periodically review and manage log files                                                  | Greater control over log management           | Time-consuming, prone to errors                                      |


### 5.5. Backup and Archiving Policies
While the previous descriptions focused on log rotation and retention, backup and archiving policies are broader concepts that encompass the entire process of preserving log data for long-term storage and access.

Table summarizing the key aspects to consider when defining backup and archiving policies for log data:

| Aspect                | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Integrity        | Ensure authenticity and integrity of stored data through checksums, digital signatures, etc.  |
